# CSC6301_Week_5
Collects data from user input to create a stack, which is then
sorted and printed.

A project to demonstrate modularization. This code was an example of code
reusability, with input, sorting, and printing completed using the files
generated in the Week 4 project for the LinkedList. This reduced duplication
of code. Also, use of the java utilities for Stack, Scanner, and Collections,
relies on the built-in functionality of java, reducing overhead for these
tasks. By relying on these already established lines of code, this week's
project required minimal new code and updates to the documentation to convert
the linked list project into a stack project.

To run, first compile on Command line using

javac -d. *.java

then to run on Command line using

java Stack.java
